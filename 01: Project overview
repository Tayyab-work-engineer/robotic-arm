Project Overview:
For this project, I will be making a robotic arm that can be moved by some potentiometers. 
This will be a 3 week project, where each day I will be learning a part of the robotic arm
and towards the end, the robotic arm will come to life and it will be well planned and 
tested.


Components:
Arduino Uno
Servo motors (x4)
Popsicle Sticks(x3)
Potentiometers (x3)
Double stick tape and Single Tape
Battery 5V
